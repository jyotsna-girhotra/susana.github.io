A short post! If you're having trouble changing your Github pages theme's CSS, and have been following the
instructions on the [Github help page](https://help.github.com/articles/customizing-css-and-html-in-your-jekyll-theme/#customizing-your-jekyll-themes-css), know that these
instructions are out of date.

Per the instructions detailed on the [Minima theme repo](https://github.com/jekyll/minima#customization), your file should be named `main.scss` and located directly under the `assets` directory. I.e. `<your-username>/assets/main.scss`.
